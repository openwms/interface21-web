# Web Worms: Anthropoda

 The Anthropoda module eases the use and configuration of security in applications. It is built on top of Spring Security and pre-configures
 Spring Security accordingly. Especially when applications deal with OAuth2, Spring Security OAuth2 takes a lot of complexity and error-prone
 low-level token handling away. But Spring Security OAuth2 does not limit the feature set the OAuth2 implementation offers, this leads to a
 framework that is complex by nature (like the base technology is).



## A. Basic Authentication

## B. OAuth2 Authorization
